# URCap-ScriptCommunicator

This sample implements a Java class to: 
 - Send URScript commands for immediate execution by URControl
 - Extract a variable from URScript to Java
 - Proxy URScript functions to Java

Check out the package ["com.jbm.urcap.sample.scriptCommunicator.communicator"](https://github.com/BomMadsen/URCap-ScriptCommunicator/tree/master/com.jbm.urcap.sample.scriptCommunicator/src/main/java/com/jbm/urcap/sample/scriptCommunicator/communicator).
You can run "InterfaceTester.java" to try out the features. 
Or install the URCap and navigate to the Installation node, to test the features from a robot/URSim. 

Start by building a ScriptCommand. 
Then either send it using ScriptSender(), or extract a variable from it using the ScriptExporter(). 

Have fun!
